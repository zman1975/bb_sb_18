<hr>
<H2>Tuesday</H2>
<p>Another beautiful morning. Mom had some work to do, so the rest of the family worked hard to make as much noise as possible. Aside from a walk around the local neighborhood, a pretty low key day, with dinner at the cabin and a family viewing of 'Alexander and the Horrible, Rotten, Terrible day' or something along those lines. </p>
