<hr>
<H2>Beavers Bend State Park (Near Broken Bow, OK)</H2>
<p lang="eng_us">This year's Spring break took us to Broken Bow lake in Beavers Bend State Park. About 10 miles north of <b>Broken Bow, Oklahoma</b>, this destination was close enough for us to drive and take the dogs with us.</p>
<p>We spent Sunday to Friday at "<a href="https://www.vrbo.com/895504?unitId=1443445">Owl Always Love You</a>" cabin, offered by Blue Beaver Luxury Cabins, enjoying the great outdoors, with the benefits of a luxury cabin in the woods.</p>

Leaving from our house Sunday morning, the drive was around 180 miles...unfortunately, between food and bathroom breaks, it took a bit longer than four hours.</p>
<p>Once we arrived, the family had a list of activities to accomplish:</p>
