<h1 id="top">Munoz Family Vacation - Spring Break 2018</h1>
<hr>
<H2>Wednesday</H2>
<p>After a cold night, which I was able to enjoy multiple times while waiting for Barley to go to the bathroom, the day warmed up nicely with clear sunny skies. Jen had to work most of the morning but then we loaded everyone into the car for a tip to Cedar Bluff hiking trail. </p>
<p>Heading east out of Hochatown, we enjoyed a fairly quick but scenic drive through the state park, around portions of the lake and over the Broken Bow lake dam.</p>

<p>From the website: Cedar Bluff Nature Trail:
Cedar Bluff starts across from Dogwood Campground. This trail is designated to be walked CLOCKWISE. Start on your left and at each junction turn right, you will come out where you started. The trail is marked with blue on white tree blazes. Stay on the marked trail, NO SHORTCUTS PLEASE. CAUTION: occasionally the creek floods causing the lower portion of this trail to become hazardous.
Level of difficulty: Both <span style="color: green;text-decoration: underline;">easy</span> grade and a hill climb.
Approximate Trail Length: 1 mile</p>
<p>I can assure you, this was not an EASY climb for Ms. B. The first 0.3 miles were a fairly easy grade, but the trail quickly turned into a steep decline, through a valley and dry creek bed, followed by an equally steep climb up the other side of the valley. The boys and I took Duke and enjoyed the extended hike, while Jen stayed with Barley at the top of the first hill.</p>
<p>Returning to our car shortly before a 1pm, we got everyone some water and started on our way out of the park. Jen had a conference call in about 5 minutes and with any luck we would be back in working cell phone coverage just in time.</p>
<p>Within ten seconds of driving we were all alarmed to hear Jaxon screaming from the back as if some wild animal had snuck into our car and was about to attack....although initally alarming, I'm sad to say I did have to laugh when we realized the terror was due to Duke having apparently drank too quickly and proceeded to vomit all over Jaxon's shirt and pants. Yuk.</p>
<p>After a quick stock to clean up, we were on our way yet again. Already a few minutes late, Jen was anxious to get somewhere with cell service so she could join her call. </p>
<p>No such luck. Remember that distant siren we had heard somewhere earlier? We also had a vague recollection of some posted road signs we passed on the drive in regarding a siren and something about rapidly rising waters... Well, apparently this was not a test. Or maybe it was. Either way, the road we used to come into the park was now closed shortly before we got back to the dam.  Sorry Jen</p>
<p>Back the other way, it took us about 30 minutes longer to reach home than originally planned. Much too late for Jen's call and all the while trying to keep the windows up far enough to prevent Duke from falling out, and down enough to minimize the sour smell of dog puke.</p>
