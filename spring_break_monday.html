<h1 id="top">Munoz Family Vacation - Spring Break 2018</h1>
<hr>
<H2>Monday</H2>
<div class="with_img"><p>Cabin facing east, we began our vacation almost concurrently with the start of daylight saving time and a very early 7am sunrise welcoming everyone to the new day. Attempting to take the boys and dogs hiking, we made our way into the park, only to find the entrance we chose was closed near the water due to recent flooding.</p> 
<p><img class="align-right medium" src="images/IMG_0302.jpg">Switching plans, we headed into the metropolis of Hochatown and hit the Guns and Ammo store for some air rifle pellets. Cole and Daddy spent much of the afternoon destroying some Coca-Cola cans and empty water bottles from about 30-50 yards.</p></div>

<div class="with_img"><p><img class="align-left medium" src="images/IMG_0307.jpg">Part of the early evening was spent either loosly playing some cornhole, or simply playing toss the bag back and forth with Jaxon.</p></div>

<h3 id="Dining">Fine Dining</h3>
<p><img class="align-right" src="images/greatful_head.jpg">Dinner took us to the world famous <a href="http://gratefulheadpizza.com/"; target="_blank"><i>Greatful Head Pizza</i></a> in Hochatown, OK.<br>Although likely the finest dinning establishment in the greater Hochatown area, our order of the <a href="http://gratefulheadpizza.com/portfolio/tree-hugger/"; target="_blank">Tree Hugger</a> pizza was edible, but definitely not worthy of the recommendations we had received. Likely due to a seemingly constant level of high traffic, our pizza seemed rushed, with ingredients left whole on top and a crust only partially cooked was apparently rushed from the oven a few minutes early.</p>

<p>Dinner was followed by a few games of Telestrations, a campfire with hot chocolate and smores, and finally a nice soak in the hot tub before calling it a night.</p>
