<hr>
<H2>Thursday</H2>
<p>Pancakes for breakfast, some cornhole, and a quick walk for Barley, we headed out shortly before noon for anothe crack at the "1 mile" hike. This time without Barley, we finished the first mile in no time. Still no visible loop, we continued over the next ridge, around the bend, over the creek and through the woods. Only to find ourselves on another ridge with a view to the next valley and our walking trail continuing on the other side. Foiled again, we turned back. Both boys enjoyed themselves so I would still call it a success. About a half-mile from the car, we discovered a 'hidden' trail which coincidentely looped back down to our original trail and connected about 100 yards away from where we started the hike...if only we had listed to Cole in the first place.</p>
<p>Apparently we ended up on Skyline trail, which would have ended up being a great hike however much longer than we had anticipated and likely in need of some additional water and supplies before we would have been able to make it back to the car.</p>
